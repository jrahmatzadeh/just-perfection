- Write a simple and readable code.

- All functions and methods should be testable inside *lib* folder.

- Curly brackets for function, class, method and CSS class should be in new line.

- Class name, function, method names and variables should be camel cased.

- Only main files are allowed in the root folder (such as extension.js, prefs.js, stylesheet.css, metadata.json).

## Translation

- You can find main translation file (pot file) in *po/main.pot*. That's the translation reference file.

- Initial language translation for current languages has been translated via online services. Feel free to edit that.

- Only the extension package on GNOME Shell extensions website can have locale folder and that should be generated with *scripts/generate-mo.sh*. Avoid adding locale folder to the repository.

*This file may be updated in the future. Any change should be applied to all files in this repository.*
